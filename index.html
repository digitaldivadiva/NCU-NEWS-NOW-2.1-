This week is the NCU presidential debate between Liam O'Reilly and Tex Austin. With tension rising and between the two parties. The debate will begin this Friday 3:00 and will be posted on our officially YouTube channel. Past debates in the NCU have turned many peoples votes in the past and is one of the biggest events in the college with many students eagerly awaiting the final results. The Debate often turn into heated screaming matches and don’t often actually involve much policy discussion but would it be fun any other way.

<p>
Both parties have formed cult followings around the college with many altercations occurring on the grounds. Emotions are flying with people in huge anticipation about the upcoming debate. It has causes much unkind discourse and it’s worrying to see what actions people will take if there favourite does not come out on top.
</p>
 
<p> 
When speaking to Tex Austin he told us "Expecting education from college is ridiculous to say how much money we spend". This comment has come with people excited about the new look Tex will bring to the college but its yet be seen if anyone will be able to get jobs after college.  Liam countered this points saying " Education is the only reason college even exists". It’s clear both sides have totally different views but who will out students side with. We at NCU News Now will be covering all the drama including more the debate say stay toned because you won’t want to miss a single thing.
